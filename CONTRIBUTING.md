## Contribution Guide Overview
This guide provides steps on how to make contributions, report bugs, and become a part of the ongoing development of `Socket Runtime`.  
If you are just started learning about Socket Runtime, you can start from [here](https://socketsupply.co/guides/).  

### Setup and build the framework

To contribute to the project you need to clone the main repository first and install the dependencies. 

#### MacOS and Linux

```bash
git clone git@github.com:socketsupply/socket.git
cd socket 
./bin/install.sh
```

#### Windows
```bash
git clone git@github.com:socketsupply/socket.git
cd socket 
.\bin\install.ps1
```

### Project directory structure

The project is structured as follows:
- [`api`](api/): contains the JavaScript API for Socket Runtime
- [`bin`](bin/): contains the useful scripts for building and maintaining the project
- [`npm`](npm/): contains the source code for the npm packages
- [`src`](src/): contains the source code for the native part of the project
- [`test`](test/): contains the tests for the project  

Source: https://github.com/socketsupply/socket

#### `api`

The `api` folder contains the JavaScript API for Socket Runtime. It consists of the built-in modules that are available in the runtime and the `socket` package that is published to npm (i.e. `socket:fs`, `socket:crypto`, etc.).
These modules have native bindings to the underlying C++/Objective-C/Kotlin code and libuv to expose the platform
capabilities to the JavaScript code.

#### `bin`

This directory contains useful scripts for building the project on different platforms, managing versions,
generating documentation, publishing npm packages, etc.

#### `npm`

This directory consists of the JavaScrip wrappers for the native code, build scripts and package directories.
You can also find the official Socket Runtime Node.js backend in the
[`npm/packages/@socketsupply/socket-node`](npm/packages/%40socketsupply/socket-node/) directory.

#### `src`

The `src` directory contains the native code for the Socket Runtime:
- [`cli`](src/cli/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime CLI
- [`core`](src/core/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime core, such as Bluetooth support,
File System, UDP, Peer-to-Peer capabilities, JavaScript bindings, etc.
- [`desktop`](src/desktop/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime library for desktop platforms
- [`android`](src/android/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime library for Android
- [`ios`](src/ios/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime library for iOS
- [`ipc`](src/ipc/): contains the source code for the Socket Runtime IPC library
- [`process`](src/process/): contains the source code for the process management
- [`window`](src/window/): contains the source code for the window management on desktop platforms

#### `test`

This directory contains the actual Socket Runtime application that is used for testing the native code and the JavaScript API.
