### Description

Web Developers use `Socket runtime` to create apps for any OS, desktop, and mobile. You can use plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite front-end libraries like Next.js, React, Svelte, or Vue.  

The `Socket runtime CLI` outputs hybrid native-web apps that combine your code with the runtime. Your code is rendered using the OS's native "WebView" component. Platform features are implemented natively and made available to the JavaScript environment in a way that is secure and fully sandboxed on every platform. Native APIs like Bluetooth and UDP make local-first and peer-to-peer software design patterns as first class considerations.

### Features

* Any backend &mdash; Business logic can be written in any language, Python, Rust, Node.js, etc. The backend is even completely optional.
* Any frontend &mdash; Use your favorite frontend framework to create your UIs: React, Svelte, Vue, and more.
* Batteries Included &mdash; Native Add-ons are supported, but we ship everything you need for the majority of use cases.
* Local-first &mdash; A full-featured, familiar File system API, native add-ons and full cross platform support for Bluetooth.
* Not just Cloud &mdash; P2P helps you reliably move work out of the cloud, beyond the edge, and onto the devices that can communicate directly with each other.
* Maintainable &mdash; Socket runtime has Zero external dependencies, and a smaller code base than any other competing project.
* Lean & Fast &mdash; Socket runtime has a smaller memory footprint and creates smaller binaries than any other competing project.

### Building your first Socket app!

`Create Socket App` is similar to React's `Create React App`, we provide a few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so you can get coding on a production-quality app as quickly as possible.  
Please check [create-socket-app Repo](https://github.com/socketsupply/create-socket-app) to get started and to learn more.  
You can also check our `Examples` in the [Examples Repo](https://github.com/socketsupply/socket-examples).  


### Documentation

The full documentation can be found on the [Socket Runtime](https://socketsupply.co/) website.  
The `Socket Runtime` documentation covers Socket APIs, includes examples, multiple guides (`Apple`, `Desktop`, and `Mobile`), `P2P` documentation, and more.


### Testing

`Socket` provides a built-in `test runner` similar to `node:test` which outputs the test results in [TAP](https://testanything.org/) format.
 You can also check [`test/`](test/) for the unit and integration test suite.
