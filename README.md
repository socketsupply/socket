### Description

Web Developers use `Socket Runtime` to create apps for any OS, desktop, or mobile. You can use plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite front-end libraries for example React, Svelte, and Vue.

`Socket Runtime` exposes primitives needed for building peer-to-peer and local-first applications, such as Bluetooth, UDP, and robust file system access. Our P2P component can help you connect your app's users, and let them communicate directly, without the cloud or any servers at all.  

`The Socket Runtime CLI` compiles applications into hybrid-native applications &mbasp; meaning, a combination of web code running in a platform's "WebView" along with platform-native code: Kotlin/Java on Android, Swift/Objective-C on iOS, C++ on Windows or Linux, etc.

### üí° Features

* Local First, a full-featured File system API & Bluetooth.
* P2P & Cloud, built to support a new generation of apps that can connect directly to each other by providing a high-performance UDP API.
* Use any backend, business logic can be written in any language, Python, Rust, Node.js, etc. The backend is even completely optional.
* Use any frontend, you can use your favorite frontend framework to create your UIs: React, Svelte, Vue and more.
* Maintainable, zero dependencies, and a smaller code base than any other competing project.
* Lean & Fast, uses a smaller memory footprint and creates smaller binaries than any other competing project.

### üß± Building your first Socket app !

`Create Socket App` is similar to React's `Create React App`, we provide a few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so you can get coding on a production-quality app as quickly as possible.  
Please check [create-socket-app Repo](https://github.com/socketsupply/create-socket-app) to get started and to learn more.  
You can also check our `Examples` in the [Examples Repo](https://github.com/socketsupply/socket-examples).  


### üìö Documentation

The full documentation can be found on the [Socket Runtime](https://socketsupply.co/) website.  
The `Socket Runtime` documentation covers Socket APIs, includes examples, multiple guides (`Apple`, `Desktop`, and `Mobile`), `P2P` documentation, and more.


### üß™ Testing

`Socket` provides a built-in `test runner` similar to `node:test` which outputs the test results in [TAP](https://testanything.org/) format.
 You can also check: [`test/`](test/) for the unit and integration test suite.
