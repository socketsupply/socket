### Description

`Socket Runtime`. provides a range of tools and software utilities to help developers build powerful application experiences using standard web technologies `(HTML, CSS, and JS)`. These applications are compiled by Socket's tools into hybrid-native applications -- meaning a combination of web code running in a platform's "WebView" (embedded browser) along with platform-native code: Java on Android, Swift/Objective-C on iOS, C++ on Windows or Linux, etc.

These compiled applications can be distributed through major application stores, such as Google Play (Android, ChromeOS), App Store (iOS, MacOS), and Microsoft Store (Windows). These apps can thus be distributed and run on all major consumer computing platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

### üí° Features

* Maintainable, zero dependencies and a smaller code base than any other competing project.
* Lean & Fast, uses a smaller memory footprint and creates smaller binaries than any other competing project.
