# Socket Runtime

### Description

Web Developers use Socket Runtime to create apps for any OS, desktop or mobile.

You can use plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite
front-end libraries for example React, Svelte, and Vue.

Socket Runtime exposes primitives needed for building peer-to-peer and
local-first applications, such as Bluetooth, UDP, and robust file system access.
