/**
 * @module DNS
 *
 * This module enables name resolution. For example, use it to look up IP
 * addresses of host names. Although named for the Domain Name System (DNS),
 * it does not always use the DNS protocol for lookups. dns.lookup() uses the
 * operating system facilities to perform name resolution. It may not need to
 * perform any network communication. To perform name resolution the way other
 * applications on the same system do, use dns.lookup().
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```js
 * import { lookup } from 'socket:dns'
 * ```

/**
 * Resolves a host name (e.g. `example.org`) into the first found A (IPv4) or
 * AAAA (IPv6) record. All option properties are optional. If options is an
 * integer, then it must be 4 or 6 â€“ if options is 0 or not provided, then IPv4
 * and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.
 *
 * From the node.js website...
 *
 * > With the all option set to true, the arguments for callback change to (err,
 * addresses), with addresses being an array of objects with the properties
 * address and family.
 *
 * > On error, err is an Error object, where err.code is the error code. Keep in
 * mind that err.code will be set to 'ENOTFOUND' not only when the host name does
 * not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways such as no available
 * file descriptors. dns.lookup() does not necessarily have anything to do with
 * the DNS protocol. The implementation uses an operating system facility that
 * can associate names with addresses and vice versa. This implementation can
 * have subtle but important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program.
 * Please take some time to consult the Implementation considerations section
 * before using dns.lookup().
 *
 * @see {@link https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns_dns_lookup_hostname_options_callback}
 * @param {string} hostname - The host name to resolve.
 * @param {(object|intenumberger)=} [options] - An options object or record family.
 * @param {(number|string)=} [options.family=0] - The record family. Must be 4, 6, or 0. For backward compatibility reasons,'IPv4' and 'IPv6' are interpreted as 4 and 6 respectively. The value 0 indicates that IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both returned. Default: 0.
 * @param {function} cb - The function to call after the method is complete.
