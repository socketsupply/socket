# Configuration
## Overview


The configuration file is an INI file (`socket.ini`) in the root of every Socket runtime project.
The file is read at compile time. Sometimes it's useful to overide its values or keep some of the
values locally, only on your computer (e.g. `[ios] simulator_device`) or secrets 
(e.g. `[ios] codesign_identity`, `[ios] provisioning_profile`, etc.); this can be done by
creating a file called `.sscrc` in the root of the project. It is possible to override both
Command Line Interface (CLI) and Configuration File (INI) options.

Example:

`socket.ini`:
```ini
; other settings

[build]

headless = false

; other settings
```

`.sscrc`:
```ini
[build]

platform = ios ; override the `ssc build --platform` CLI option


[settings.ios] ; override the `[ios]` section in `socket.ini`

codesign_identity = "iPhone Developer: John Doe (XXXXXXXXXX)"
distribution_method = "release-testing"
provisioning_profile = "johndoe.mobileprovision"
simulator_device = "iPhone 15"
```
