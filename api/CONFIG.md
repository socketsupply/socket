# Configuration basics

The configuration file is a simple INI `socket.ini` file in the root of the project.
The file is read on startup and the values are used to configure the project.
Sometimes it's useful to overide the values in `socket.ini` or keep some of the values local (e.g. `[ios] simulator_device`)
or secret (e.g. `[ios] codesign_identity`, `[ios] provisioning_profile`, etc.)
This can be done by creating a file called `.sscrc` in the root of the project.
It is possible to override both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Configuration File (INI) options.

Example:

`socket.ini`:
```ini
; other settings

[build]

headless = false

; other settings
```

`.sscrc`:
```ini
[build]

platform = ios ; override the `ssc build --platform` CLI option


[settings.ios] ; override the `[ios]` section in `socket.ini`

codesign_identity = "iPhone Developer: John Doe (XXXXXXXXXX)"
distribution_method = "ad-hoc"
provisioning_profile = "johndoe.mobileprovision"
simulator_device = "iPhone 15"
```
